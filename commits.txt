changes:
Instead of the feature extraction part in the main code of the paper, I replaced the suggested options with Xception.
I took the Xception code as a reference. And instead of the classifier in the main code, I used SVM. The dataset used is Celeb-DF.
error:
download dataset in colab and drive from kaggle
